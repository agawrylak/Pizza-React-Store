# Pizza-React-Store

## General info
After making PizzaRep I wasn't satisfied. I really don't like making websites in pure HTML&CSS. My main issues? Code looks like a big wall of text, a lot of ctrl+c/ctrl+v for each template, also having to manually edit every single template for each change in elements like navigation bar is tiresome. I decided I can do better. After research I chose to use this opportunity to learn JavaScript and React. 
## Project Goal
My goal was to learn React (to make the site look a lot better) and improve my Spring skills. 
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java
* Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL
* React.js
* CSS (with the help of Material-UI's styling solution)
* MaterialUI
## Issues
* Project is not yet completed, but if I could go back in time and make some changes, I would use Gatsby/Next.js. I decided to go with pure React because of my lack of experience, but now I know there are far better alternatives for static websites. 
* Right now I would choose Styled Components instead of Material-UI's styling solution, because as far as I know it's an industry standard.
